# Accident Severity Prediction
This project was done as the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional certificate on Coursera.
I have used the library folium to create several layered heatmaps to showcase various hot zones for collisions of various kind, with each layer representing a year.
For plotting, I have used area plots and pie charts to differentiate and compare various values, also a heat map created using seaborn has been used for feature selection.
Finally for predicting values, I have used the following algorithms: -
  1) Decision Trees
  2) K Nearest Neighbors
  3) Naive Bayes
